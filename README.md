# Money Modeling

This project contains a Jupyter notebook (`modeling.ipynb`) that demonstrates Random Forest regression modeling using scikit-learn. The notebook includes:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Training a Random Forest regressor
- Model evaluation (MAE, MSE, RMSE)
- Feature importance analysis

## Requirements

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook modeling.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the cells to train and evaluate the model.

## Dependencies
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
